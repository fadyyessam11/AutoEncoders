The objective of this code is to implement a convolutional autoencoder (CAE) model using Keras to denoise images from the CIFAR-100 dataset. The process involves the following steps:

Preprocessing: Load and normalize CIFAR-100 images, add Gaussian noise to simulate noisy data, and prepare training and test datasets.

Autoencoder Model Construction: Design an autoencoder with an encoder-decoder architecture using convolutional layers. The encoder compresses noisy images into a lower-dimensional representation, and the decoder reconstructs the clean image from the encoded representation.

Training: Train the autoencoder on noisy input images with clean target images. Use binary cross-entropy as the loss function to optimize the reconstruction of clean images from noisy inputs.

Testing and Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance by visualizing the encoded representations and comparing the original, noisy, and denoised images to assess the effectiveness of the autoencoder in removing noise.

Fine-tuning: Re-train the model on clean images to further improve the reconstruction quality and evaluate the model's denoising ability by comparing the results before and after additional training.

Through this approach, the model learns to effectively remove noise from images, making it useful for image denoising applications.
